# Employee-Entry-Sheet
I’d like to create a simple user time/data entry clock, that would identify employees’ ids, clock-in times, names, building locations by LETTER, building location cities, salaries, genders, and total working hours. Based on what I’m trying to do, the program should identify first the employee’s id by typing it in, from there, it should output all data and info related to the one self, as well as to display their entry time and clock out time.
