# Employee-Entry-Sheet
I’d like to create a simple user time/data entry clock, that would identify employees’ ids, clock-in times, names, building locations by LETTER, building location cities, salaries, genders, and total working hours. Based on what I’m trying to do, the program should identify first the employee’s id by typing it in, from there, it should output all data and info related to the one self, as well as to display the amount of hours workded. The employee should be able to use his/her ID number as many times as needed from any authorized department. The clock-in information should appear in plain text, including the employee’s ID number for better reference, so all these infomation can then be retrieve by payroll.
